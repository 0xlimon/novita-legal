## Third-Party Services

### Lyrics Search
When you use the lyrics search feature, your request is processed through third-party lyrics providers. These providers have their own privacy policies:

- The only data transmitted is the song title and artist name
- No personal or device information is included
- Searches are not linked to any user profile

### WebView Browser
The in-app browser (WebView) is used for:
- Searching lyrics on Google
- Opening external links

When using the WebView, standard web browsing data may be processed by the websites you visit. We recommend reviewing Google's privacy policy when using the search feature.

**Important:** The WebView operates independently, and Notiva does not access or collect any cookies, login credentials, or browsing history from your web sessions. Any data you enter in the WebView is handled directly by the visited websites, not by our App.

---

## Data Storage and Security

- **All app data is stored locally** on your device
- We use Android's standard security features to protect stored data
- We do not have servers that store your personal information
- Uninstalling the app removes all associated data from your device

---

## Data Deletion

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over your data:

- **Delete all app data:** Go to Android Settings → Apps → Notiva → Storage → Clear Data
- **Delete cache only:** Go to Android Settings → Apps → Notiva → Storage → Clear Cache
- **Complete removal:** Uninstall the App to remove all associated data

No data is stored on our servers, so there is nothing to request deletion of from our side.

---

## Children's Privacy

Notiva is a general audience app and does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us immediately.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:
- Updating the "Last Updated" date
- App update notes (if significant changes)

We encourage you to review this Policy periodically.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- ✅ Access all your data (it's already on your device!)
- ✅ Delete your data (uninstall the app or clear app data)
- ✅ Deny permissions (some features may not work)
- ✅ Use the app offline (except lyrics search)
